## Overview
Frontend mentor is a great companion for learning frontend development. This challenge was slightly complicated as i didnt had the figma or sketch files but im happy that i could make it as realistic as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process
I first went on to design my own mockup of the design using figma and then wrote html and css using flexbox.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned many things but the thing im proud of my self is making the nft-card-components active stage.

### Continued development

From now on im going to create mockups first because believe me it saves a lot of time and the develoment becomes faster.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for buildin the mockup . I really liked this pattern of building mockups first and will use it going forward.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand the active pseudo element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
